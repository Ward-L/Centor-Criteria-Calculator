# Centor-Criteria-Calculator

This calculator is a simple GUI made using the Tkinter module in Python to test my skills and logic learnt on a basic level.

The centor criteria is a tool used to assess whether antibiotics should be used in cases of tonsilitis, of which can be bacterial or viral in origin. 4 simple criteria should be asked, or examined regarding a patient:
1) Do they have a cough (or an absence of cough)?
2) Do they have a fever?
3) Do they have tonsilar exudate?
4) Do they have tender cervical anterior lymphadenopathy?

Each of these features gives a score which is accumulated. A score of >=3, according to NICE guidelines suggests antibiotics should be prescribed as it suggest bacterial infection. This simple calculator helps with this reccomendation.
